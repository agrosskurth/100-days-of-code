# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 January 5, 2018
I completed the last 19 tasks for the JQuery section of FreecodeCamp,
and began working on the first HTML project, Build a Tribute.

### Day 2 January 6, 2018
I completed the first Tribute project. I make it look a little too similar
to the original tribute, so I will look to make a lot of changes to the next
project (Portfolio Project), and make it more of my own. I have started work and
research on this page, and will work more on it tomorrow.
