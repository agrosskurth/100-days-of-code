# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 January 5, 2018
I completed the last 19 tasks for the JQuery section of FreecodeCamp,
and began working on the first HTML project, Build a Tribute.

### Day 2 January 6, 2018
I completed the first Tribute project. I make it look a little too similar
to the original tribute, so I will look to make a lot of changes to the next
project (Portfolio Project), and make it more of my own. I have started work and
research on this page, and will work more on it tomorrow.

### Day 3 January 7, 2018
I worked on my Portfolio project today. There wasn't a lot of progress made,
but there was a lot of research done today about JQuery, iframes and objects.
I want to make sure this webpage is professionally made, so I will be putting
a lot of effort into reading and learning how to do the things I want to do
with the page.

### Day 4 January 8, 2018
I worked on the C# Coding project I was sent by my friend Rusty. It's for a possible
job interview if I can get it working and. I am working on getting it functioning
within the next week.
